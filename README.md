# The evolution of compositional hierarchical structure in the lab: experimental data sets

This text file explains the supporting data file containing the languages that evolved in the iterated learning experiments 1 and 2 in the submitted manuscript 'Compositional hierarchical structure evolves through cultural transmission: an experimental study’. You can find the code used to run the experiment in _Experiments.zip_[`Python 2.7’, `PsychoPy v1.82.01’]

’SKTS2018_languages.xlsx' contains 8 spreadsheets, divided in groups of 4. Each group belongs to one experiment, and each sheet to the data of an experimental transmission chain.  Sheets that belong to Experiment 1 are named `Exp1’ and marked red; those that belong to Experiment 2, are named `Exp2’ and marked blue. 

### Descriptions of the column headings for each sheet in _SKTS2018_languages.xlsx_ are as follows: 

- `Meaning’ : the meaning the descriptions refer to. (PFV stands for perfective or terminated aspect; its absence, indicate imperfective or ongoing aspect.) 

- `Initial Language’ : the randomised initial language used to train the first generation of the transmission chain 

- `Generation 1’ : the language produced by the first generation in the transmission chain. Generation 1 is trained on a randomly selected set of items from the initial language (44 in Exp 1 and 40 in Exp 2).
 
- `Generation 2 to 8’ : the language produced by the corresponding generation (2 to 8) in the transmission chain. Each generation is trained on a randomly selected set of items from the previous generation (44 in Exp 1 and 40 in Exp 2 and Exp3).
